Superstore Sales Performance Analysis

1. Project Objective
  The goal of this project was to analyze historical sales data from a multi-national retailer to identify growth opportunities and inefficiencies. I focused on three main pillars: Sales        Trends, Regional Performance, and Product Profitability.

2. The Dataset
  ●	Source: Kaggle Superstore Sales
  ●	Size: ~9,800 rows of transactional data.
  ●	Key Columns: Order Date, Region, Category, Sub-Category and Sales.

3. Data Cleaning Process
  Before building the dashboard, I performed the following steps to ensure data integrity:
    ●	Standardized Dates: Converted Order Date from text to Date format to allow for time-series grouping.
    ●	Validation: Removed duplicate Order IDs and checked for null values in the Region column.

4. Key Business Insights
  Based on the dashboard, I discovered the following:
  ●	Seasonal Peaks: Sales consistently spike in November and December, likely due to holiday promotions.
  ●	Top Performer Category: The Technology category drives the highest revenue per unit sold.
  ●	Top Performer Sub-Category: The Phones sub-category drives the highest revenue per unit sold.

5. Dashboard Features
  ●	Dynamic Slicers: Users can filter the entire view by Region, Year, or Segment.
  ●	KPI Tracking: Real-time calculation of Total Sales.
  ●	Visual Hierarchy: Used a Ranked Bar Chart for sub-categories to quickly identify outliers.
